# Noise-Filtering-on-Voice-Recordings
This project implements a simple noise filtering system for pre-recorded voice signals using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and a Band-Pass Filter. The goal is to isolate and preserve the frequencies associated with human speech while attenuating unwanted background noise.
